Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, termed RESTful Web services (RWS), provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.

# Routing
** Routing ** refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.
[Basic Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html)</br>

# Middleware
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. These functions are used to modify req and res objects for tasks like parsing request bodies, adding response headers, etc.
